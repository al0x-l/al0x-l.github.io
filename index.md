### CPSC 120
 
* Lab 6

    One of my favorite labs were lab 6, part 2. It was the lab about creating a guessing game. It was my favorite lab because I had my girlfriend play test it for me. I even used a while loop to force her to play forever. Don't worry I fixed it before I turned it in!

* Lab 5

    Another lab I liked was lab 5, part 3. It was the lab where we first created the Blackjack game. That lab was fun because we used for loops and created checks to make a working game of Blackjack. I loved all the attention to detail we needed to a game.

* Lab 7

    Another lab I liked was lab 7, part 2. It was the lab where we made Blackjack in a more optimized way. I loved the idea of creating something in a more effiecent way. We took advantage of functions and boolian logic to optimize the program.
